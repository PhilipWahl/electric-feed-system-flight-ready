Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) requires a Flight-Ready Electric Feed System for their upcoming Launch Vehicle 4 (LV4). An Electric Feed System (EFS) is an electronically controlled pump system used to provide the necessary pressure to deliver liquid propellant to the engine. The EFS must be cryogenic compatible to withstand the environment that the liquid oxygen (LOX) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) propellants create. In traditional amateur rocketry, a high pressure "blow down" system is used to deliver propellant to the engine. These systems are costly and require heavy fuel tanks causing them to be less than ideal for launch. Creating an EFS as an alternative to a pressurized tank is a challenging and innovative task that this capstone hopes to achieve.
